When a Coronalda arrives, we astronauts need to protect ourselves! Its energy is so strong that it can be dangerous for us and for the station's equipment. That's why, when scientists on Earth warn us that a 'wave' like the Coronalda is coming, we move to safer areas of the station and even cancel our spacewalks. It's like preparing for a storm—except it's a space storm!"} />

When a Coronalda arrives, radio communication can get really 'static-y' and navigation systems like GPS can become a bit confused. To keep everyone safe, we sometimes need to change our route and fly away from the poles during these space storms. The Coronalda makes us take a different, safer path!"} />

My tractor uses GPS to plant seeds in perfectly straight lines, without wasting space. But when a Coronalda messes with satellite signals, my GPS can be off by a few meters! That can throw off my entire planting. That's why we keep an eye on space weather forecasts to know the best time to use our high-precision machines."} />

My job is to make sure electricity reaches your home so you can turn on the TV and play video games. The energy from a Coronalda can travel through the long wires of our power grid and cause overloads—like an excess of electricity. This can damage transformers and even cause blackouts in entire cities! When we know a solar storm is on the way, we work to protect the grid and prevent power outages for everyone."} />
